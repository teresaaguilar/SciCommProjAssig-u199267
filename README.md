The TFG I'm presenting is from Raquel Rodríguez Martín. 

The aim of this article was to predict femur fractures using radiomics and machine learning, as a consequence of osteoporosis. Even though there are many available techniques for assessing fracture risk, they are not good enough, resulting in limited accuracy that prevents their clinical application.

Her hypothesis was that integrating heterogeneous and complex characteristics of the bone tissue through radiomics at both the global and local scales will lead to improved prediction of fracture risk. She proposed to use radiomic feature selection methods to identify the most relevant ones and advanced machine learning to integrate them. 

The proposed predictive model was validated using 63 cases, including 30 patients who suffered a hip fracture after taking the scan. [1]
